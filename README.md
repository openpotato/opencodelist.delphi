# OpenCodeList for Delphi

A [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) library for parsing and building [OpenCodeList](https://openpotato.github.io/opencodelist/en/) documents. 

+ Supports Delphi 12 Athens and Delphi 11 Alexandria
+ Includes class for code list documents
+ Includes class for code list set documents

## Installation

As Delphi does not have an established package manager, you have the following options:

+ Include this repository as [submodule](https://github.blog/open-source/git/working-with-submodules/) in the Git repository of your project. 

+ Keep this repository separate and add the `src` folder as a search path to your project options.

+ Copy the source code from the `src` folder into the Git repository of your project and work with a copy of the code.

## Getting started

Documentation is available in the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/openpotato/opencodelist.delphi/wiki).
